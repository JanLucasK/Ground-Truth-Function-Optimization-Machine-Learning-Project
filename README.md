## Project Description

#### Motivation:
When developing algorithms, it's essential to evaluate their performance. For classical machine learning, this involves using test datasets to assess model performance. However, not all algorithms work with static datasets; some work with functions or distributions. For instance, optimization algorithms require test functions to evaluate their performance. These test functions should closely resemble the real-world ground truth function that represents the problem to be optimized. Creating appropriate test functions that meet various requirements (e.g., difficulty, cost, diversity, flexibility, and transparency) can be challenging.

#### Problem:
The goal of this project is to generate test functions for optimization algorithms using artificial intelligence and machine learning models. The focus is on choosing suitable approaches/models and practical implementation to assess their performance. The synthetic ground truth function for evaluation will be the BBOB function suite.

## Installation

To clone the repository, change to the directory you want the git to be initialized and use following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/JanLucasK/Ground-Truth-Function-Optimization-Machine-Learning-Project.git
```

To install python and libarys from the `environment.yml` file, first install [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html). After that and cloning the repository, activate anaconda and use following command to create a new environment from the `environment.yml` file:

```
conda env create -n MLP_Env -f environment.yml
```

After that just activate the environment with:

```
conda activate MLP_Env
```

And you can start executing code from this repository.
